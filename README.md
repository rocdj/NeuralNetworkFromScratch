# NeuralNetworkFromScratch

This project was created for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course of the MSc Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex.

## Overview

In this project, I built a neural network from scratch without using any external libraries. The network is a simple feedforward neural network with backpropagation, featuring an 8-neuron hidden layer. The main goal was to understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks by implementing all the components manually.
